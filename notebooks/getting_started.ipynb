    "Matrix Linear Models (MLMs) provide a simple yet robust multivariate framework for encoding relationships and groupings in high-throughput data. MLM's flexibility allows it to encode both categorical and continuous relationships, thereby enhancing the detection of associations between responses and predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the scope of the matrix linear model framework, the model is articulated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Y = XBZ^T+E$$\n",

    "- $Y_{n \\times m}$ is the response matrix\n",
    "- $X_{n \\times p}$ is the matrix for main predictors,\n",
    "- $Z_{m \\times q}$ denotes the response attributes matrix based on supervised knowledge,\n",
    "- $E_{n \\times m}$ is the error term, \n",

    "## Data Generation\n",

    "For simplicity, we assume that both the responses and the predictors are presented as dataframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset consists of a dataframe `X`, which includes `p = 5` predictors. Among these predictors, two are categorical, and three are numerical, spread across `n = 100` samples. We then consider a response dataframe `Y` composed of `m = 250` responses. To simulate the `Y` data, we need to generate the matrices `Z`,`B`, and `E`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The matrix `Z` provides information about the response population, which corresponds to the `Y`'s columns $y_{i \\in [1, 250]}$. The dimensions of this matrix are set at `250x10`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given this setup, the coefficient matrix `B` is designed to have dimensions of `5x10`. This matches the number of predictors in `X` with the number of information categories in `Z`. Finally, we construct the noise matrix `E` containing the error terms. We generate this matrix as a normally distributed matrix ($N (0, 4) $), adding a layer of randomness to our simulation.\n"
